## **Description**

<!-- description:start -->

There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

    - Each child must have at least one candy.
    - Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == ratings.length`
- `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
- `0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 104`

### Approach: Greedy

:material-checkbox-marked-circle:{ .md-checkmark } Time complexity: $O(n)$

#### Way 1:

!!! note "Algorithmic Way"

    We initialize a `candies` array with 1 candy for each child.

    First, we go left to right: if a child has a higher rating than the one before, they get one more candy.

    Then, we go right to left: if a child has a higher rating than the one after, we ensure they have more candies by taking the max of current and one more than the next.

    Finally, we sum all `candies` and return the total.

    Time complexity `O(n)` , Space complexity `O(n)`.Where n is the number of children.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:
            n = len(ratings)
            candies = [1] * n
            # Left to right pass
            for i in range(1, n):
                if ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]:
                    candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1
            # Right to left pass
            for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
                if ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]:
                    candies[i] = max(candies[i], candies[i + 1] + 1)
            return sum(candies)
    ```

#### Way 2:

!!! note "Notes"

    We initialize two arrays `L` and `R`, where `L[i]` represents the minimum number of candies the current child should get when the current child's score is higher than the left child's score, and `R[i]` represents the minimum number of candies the current child should get when the current child's score is higher than the right child's score. Initially, `L[i]` = 1, `R[i]` = 1.

    We traverse the array from left to right once, and if the current child's score is higher than the left child's score, then `L[i] = L[i - 1] + 1`;

    Similarly, we traverse the array from right to left once, and if the current child's score is higher than theright child's score, then `R[i] = R[i+1] + 1`.
    Finally, we traverse the array of scores once, and the minimum number of candies each child should get is the maximum of `L[i]` and `R[i]`, and we add them up to get the answer.

    Time complexity `O(n)`, space complexity `O(n)`. Where `n` is the length of the array of scores.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:
            n = len(ratings)
            L = [1]*n
            R = [1]*n
            ans = 0
            for i in range(1,n):
                if ratings[i]>ratings[i-1]:
                    L[i] = L[i-1] +1

            for i in range(n-2,-1,-1):
                if ratings[i]>ratings[i+1]:
                    R[i] = R[i+1] + 1

            for l,r in zip(L,R):
                ans+=max(l,r)

            return ans
    ```
